## Projects
### Predictive Analytics for Succesful Funding in Kickstarter: Leveraging Big Data to Determine the Likelihood of Meeting Pledged Amounts
[Report](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374004731_Predictive_Analytics_for_Succesful_Funding_in_Kickstarter_Leveraging_Big_Data_to_Determine_the_Likelihood_of_Meeting_Pledged_Amounts?channel=doi&linkId=650935c661f18040c20b76c4&showFulltext=true)

An analysis of Kickstarter data and the application of machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of meeting pledged amounts. The problem addressed is the challenge faced by project creators in achieving their funding goals on the platform. The aim of the report is to provide insights and a model that can assist project creators in increasing their chances of achieving their funding goals. The contributions of this work lie in the implementation of various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest Classifier, to predict the success of Kickstarter projects.

[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ko5TIWW4R3cVKuycE2QoZNLXHnhku8-o/view?usp=sharing)

**QuickXam** is a final-year project that focuses on the development of an online examination system
using **JavaScript** and **NodeJS**. The system is designed to provide an easy and secure way for
teachers to create and manage examinations, and for students to take exams virtually. With
QuickXam, teachers can create exams, add questions, set time limits and assign grades. Students
can log in, access the exams they have been assigned, answer questions and submit their answers.
The system provides real-time feedback on completed exams and grades, and the results can be
downloaded for further analysis. QuickXam is designed to be user-friendly, efficient and reliable,
and can be customized to meet the specific needs of educational institutions.
